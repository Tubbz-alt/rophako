# Rophako

> :rotating_light: **This repo has migrated:** https://git.kirsle.net/apps/rophako

A simplistic content management system designed for
[kirsle.net](http://www.kirsle.net/).

Rophako is [Azulian](http://www.kirsle.net/wizards/translator.html) for
"website." Pronounce it however you like. I pronounce it "roe-fa-koe."

This project is currently in "beta" status. It is currently powering kirsle.net
and a couple other small sites.

Check out Rophako's official homepage and example site:
