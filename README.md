# Rophako

A simplistic content management system designed for
[kirsle.net](http://www.kirsle.net/).

Rophako is [Azulian](http://www.kirsle.net/wizards/translator.html) for
"website." Pronounce it however you like. I pronounce it "roe-fa-koe."

This project is under heavy construction.

# Installation

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

These may need to be installed for the dependencies to build:

**Fedora:** `libffi-devel`
