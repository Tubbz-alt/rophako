  site:
    debug: false

    # Unique name of your site, e.g. "kirsle.net"
    site_name: example.com

    # Path to your site's HTML root. Whenever Rophako tries to render a
    # template, it will check in your site's root for the template first
    # before defaulting to the fallback pages in the rophako/www folder.
    # All of the core Rophako pages, e.g. for account, blog, photo albums
    # and so on, have templates in the default site. You can override those
    # templates by creating files with the same paths in your site's root.
    site_root: "{basedir}/site/www"

    # E-mail address for site notifications (e.g. new comments and errors)
    notify_address: &ADMIN_EMAIL root@localhost

    # Default date/time format (not used by the Rophako app but referenced
    # by other spots in this config file, for easy overriding).
    _date_format: &DATE_FORMAT '%A, %B %d %Y @ %I:%M:%S %p'

    # Preferred time zone to present datetimes in. See `pytz.all_timezones` for
    # valid options here. Examples: "US/Eastern", "America/Los_Angeles" etc.

  # Database settings

  db:
    # Rophako uses a flat file JSON database system, and a Redis server sits
    # between Rophako and the filesystem. The db_root is the path on the
    # filesystem to store documents in (can be relative, default "./db")

  # Security Settings
  ###
  security:
    # Set this value to true to force SSL/TLS on your web app. Turning this on
    # will do the following:
    # - Send HTTP Strict-Transport-Security header
    # - Use secure session cookies (SSL-only)
    force_ssl: false

    # Secret key used for session cookie signing. Make this long and hard to
    # guess.
    #
    # Tips for creating a strong secret key:
    # $ python
    # >>> import os
    # >>> os.urandom(24)
    # '\xfd{H\xe5<\x95\xf9\xe3\x96.5\xd1\x01O<!\xd5\xa2\xa0\x9fR"\xa1\xa8'
    #
    # Then take that whole quoted string and paste it right in as the secret
    # key. Do NOT use that one, it was just an example. Make your own!
    secret_key: 'for the love of Arceus, change this key!'

    # Password strength: number of iterations for bcrypt password.
    bcrypt_iterations: 12

    # Proxy support. If you *KNOW* your web app will be behind a trusted proxy,
    # such as a load balancer, you can make the app accept the X-Forwarded-For
    # header to provide the user's real IP address. Do NOT set this if you are
    # not behind a proxy, otherwise a malicious user could "spoof" their address
    # by using this header.

  # List of Enabled Plugins
  ###

  # Which plugins to enable? List each plugin by module name. The plugins
  # will be assumed to be blueprints that can be attached to the main app
  # object. If you instead want to load an arbitrary Python module (i.e. to
  # define custom routes at the app layer, not in a blueprint) list those
  # under the "custom" section.
  blueprints:
    - rophako.modules.blog
    - rophako.modules.wiki
    - rophako.modules.photo
    - rophako.modules.comment
    - rophako.modules.emoticons
    - rophako.modules.contact

  # If adding custom scripts, remove the empty array and define a list like
  # in the above blueprints example.
  custom: []
