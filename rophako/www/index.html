<h1>Welcome!</h1>

This is the Rophako CMS! It's a simple web app framework written in Python that
supports a web blog, photo albums, and a commenting system. It's open source
software released under the GNU General Public License version 2. It was
designed by Noah Petherbridge to power his personal website and blog,
<a href="http://www.kirsle.net/" target="_blank">Kirsle.net</a>, but it's
also designed to be easily reusable for getting any website up and running
quickly.<p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Web Blog</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>Rophako's primary feature, apart from being a general content
            management system, is to be a web blog. The blog supports having
            multiple authors and having multiple avatars (you can upload an
            avatar for each topic your blog covers, and select the avatar when
            you post an entry).</li>
        <li>There's a built-in RSS feed for the blog so your readers can
            follow it in their RSS readers.</li>
        <li>Tag your blog posts with a list of categories and enable your
            readers to use them to read just the posts they're interested in.</li>
        <li>Blog posts can be commented on by guests on the Internet.</li>
        <li>Include graphical emoticons in your blog posts!</li>
    </ul></li>

    <li><strong>Photo Albums</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>Upload as many pictures as you want to photo albums on your site.
            The default settings allow for having relatively high-resolution
            photos (800 pixels wide), and thumbnailing is done automatically.</li>
        <li>The staff user accounts on your site can pick a photo from the
            albums to be "their" profile photo, which will be used on their
            blog posts and comments (if they don't select one of the blog
            avatars instead).</li>
        <li>Photos, like blog posts, can be commented on.</li>
        <li>Drag-and-drop user interface to rearrange your photos and photo
            albums.</li>
    </ul></li>

    <li><strong>Comments</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>Comments can be left by anyone on the Internet. A reverse CAPTCHA
            is used that stops random spam bots from posting comments.</li>
        <li>Comments can include graphical emoticons, like blog posts.</li>
        <li>Commenters can subscribe to a comment thread when they post, so that
            they'll receive e-mail notifications when somebody else replies to
            that thread. Unsubscribing is easy, too.</li>
        <li>If a commenter leaves their e-mail address,
            <a href="http://www.gravatar.com/" target="_blank">Gravatar</a>
            avatars are used. If they don't have a Gravatar, you can specify
            the default fall-back avatar to use.</li>
    </ul></li>

    <li><strong>Dual Template System</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>When Rophako wants to show the user a page, it first looks in your
            custom site's template folder before defaulting to its built-in
            templates.</li>
        <li>All of Rophako's core features (including this page!) have templates
            built in. So, you don't need to write any HTML code to get blogs,
            photo albums and everything else working!</li>
        <li>If you want to customize Rophako's built-in pages (for example, the
            blog templates), you can just add files to your custom site's folder
            with the same file names. Rophako will use your templates instead
            of its own!</li>
    </ul></li>
</ul>
